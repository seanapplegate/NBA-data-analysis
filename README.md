# Analysis of NBA Advanced Stat Leaders (2020-2021)

by Sean Applegate 

This is from a dataset from basketball reference which displays the advanced stats of NBA players in the 2020-21 season (as of 4/23/2021).

TODO: Put visualization here.

Observation: On average, guards that have a higher free throw rate and lower 3 point rate have a higher player efficiency rating. What I take from this is that the best guards in the NBA are able to both draw fouls at a high rate and are not overly reliant on perimeter shooting to be effective. These players are more likely to hit two free throws than a regular field goal, but are also capable perimeter shooters.
